## Additions and Changes

### Wand

This is a basic wand from the example code. It does nothing.
But acts as a good "hello world".

### Sticks from Firewood

Adds and new recipe for crafting sticks from firewood using a similar recipe
to firewood from logs. This makes getting sticks easier, especially at higher
quantities, while still requiring some work and two ticks of axe durability.
