# Old Steve's Mod

This is a mod for [Vintage Story](https://vintagestory.at) that focuses
on being a collection of tweaks and feature additions to improve the game.

Most of these are small QoL changes with an emphasis on taking advantage of
existing game elements and resources.

## Additions and Changes

### Wand

This is a basic wand from the example code. It does nothing.
But acts as a good "hello world".

### Sticks from Firewood

Adds and new recipe for crafting sticks from firewood using a similar recipe
to firewood from logs. This makes getting sticks easier, especially at higher
quantities, while still requiring some work and two ticks of axe durability.

### Vegetable Oil

A new liquid! Provides an alternative to animal fat for the more pacifist
players or those who struggle finding enough.

Vegetable Oil is more easily renewable, but slower due to farming
and requires the Fruitpress and a barrel to create.

### Craftable Omok Pieces

They're tiny bits of Lead and Gold, I'm not sure why these aren't craftable.
I may add the other metals at some point too.
