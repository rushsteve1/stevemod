# Steve's Mod

This is a mod for [Vintage Story](https://vintagestory.at) that focuses
on being a collection of tweaks and feature additions to improve the game.

Most of these are small QoL changes with an emphasis on taking advantage of
existing game elements and resources.

However I want to emphasize that I am **NOT** trying to make the game easier.
Just to present alternatives and new features that fit in cleanly.

Most of the ideas here have been done better by other mods.

## Additions and Changes

### Sticks from Firewood

Adds and new recipe for crafting sticks from firewood using a similar recipe
to firewood from logs. This makes getting sticks easier, especially at higher
quantities, while still requiring some work and two ticks of axe durability.

This felt necessary to me and is why I started learning VS Modding.
Getting the quantity of sticks you need in the mid-game is a _pain_.

### Vegetable Oil

A new liquid! Provides an alternative to animal fat for the more pacifist
players or those who struggle finding enough.

Vegetable Oil is more easily renewable, but slower due to farming
and requires the Fruitpress and a barrel to create.

### Craftable Omok Pieces

In a variety of metals! Having game boards in VS is brilliant!

### Two Knife Smithing

A recipe for smithing two knives at once.
More efficient than smithing one at a time.

### Metal Plates on Vertical Rack

Allows metal plates to be stored on a vertical rack.

### Iron and up Spears

Iron, Meteoric Iron, and Steel spears.
Not sure why these aren't in the game, especially with the addition of Elks
making Spears much more useful in the late game.
I tried to match the existing damage curves.

### Smeltable Arrowheads

Arrowheads can now be smelted counting as one bit.
This smooths out the early game panning grind, and is nice for decrafting
arrowheads found in ruins.
